# Instadine

## Background and Overview


InstaDine is a mobile application that connects diners with restaurants to cut down wait times and give users freedom by eliminating the need to stand in line. 

Everyone has experienced going out to a restaurant only to find long wait times before even getting to order, and even longer to get their first bite of dinner. With InstaDine, restaurants can manage queues, reservations, menus, and food orders all in one application. This allows diners to receive live data and the ability to queue up to be seated and order food ahead of time. Additional features improve dining experience, including filtering restaurants by available seats, and push notifications when tables are ready.
