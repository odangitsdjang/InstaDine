##Background and Overview

InstaDine is a mobile application that connects diners with restaurants to cut down wait times and give users freedom by eliminating the need to stand in line. 

Everyone has experienced going out to a restaurant only to find long wait times before even getting to order, and even longer to get their first bite of dinner. With InstaDine diners have access to live data, giving them the ability to find restaurants with available seats or queue up to be seated.

InstaDine is built with React Native and Redux front end and Express and MongoDB in back end.

## Design

---------------------MAIN OVERVIEW GIF HERE-----------------------------

The app is designed for diners that are on the go to quickly find and choose a restaurant that meets their needs. 

Diners open InstaDine and are taken to a map of the area at their location. From there, they are able to select markers of participating restaurants which takes them to the restaurant's info page that details if seats are available at this time and also gives users the option to queue up. 

To further help narrow down choices, the map screen also has a filter that users can toggle to display only restaurants with a selected numbers of seats available, or filter them out by current wait times.

Instadine was designed for smooth user navigation by using various nested navigators including a drawer that contains user information and links to other pages such as the user's Queue History page.
